OVERVIEW                                                    *direx-overview*

Direx is a file explorer for Neovim. It is inspired by |vim-dirvish| by Justin M
Keyes, and provides commands to modify file system and integration with |LSP|.

Concept ~

Similar to |vim-dirvish|, a Direx buffer only contains a list of paths, and a
Direx buffer name is a literal directory path. Which means you can change
current working directory to the directory opened in a Direx buffer with >vim
	:cd %

It's totally fine to slice, dice, and smash any Direx buffer: it will not
modify the filesystem. To actually modify the filesystem, you need to use one
of the |direx-commands| or |direx-mappings| that can do that.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                           *direx-configuration*

You can configure Direx using function `require('direx').setup(opts)`, with
opts being a table.

The following options are available:

`opts.default` (boolean) ~
	Use Direx as the default plugin for opening directories. Default: `true`

`opts.grep` (table) ~
    A table with the following fields:
    • `parse_args` (`"shell"|false`) ~
        Default: `"shell"`
	   	See |:Grep| for information about `parse_args` field.
	• `timeout` (number?) ~
		Default: `nil`
		Timeout for the process in milliseconds.

`opts.iconfunc` (fun(path: string): {icon: string, hl: string}) ~
    Function to add icons to direx buffer. Accepts path of file/directory as
    argument and returns a table with `icon` and `hl` keys. Default: `nil`

    For example >lua
	{
        iconfunc = function(path)
            if path:sub(-1) == '/' then
                return { icon = ' ', hl = 'Directory' }
            else
                return { icon = '󰈔 ', hl = 'Normal' }
            end
        end
	}
<
												*direx-configuration-mappings*
Key mappings can be configured by mapping the corresponding
`<Plug>(direx-<name>)` key to a custom key sequence (see |direx-mappings|).
For example, to use `<BS>` to go up a directory instead of the default
`<minus>`, add the following to your `init.lua`: >lua
	vim.keymap.set('n', '<BS>', '<Plug>(direx-up)', { desc = 'Open parent directory' })
<
	(Or in `init.vim`, add `nmap <BS> <Plug>(direx-up)`)

COMMANDS                                                    *direx-commands*

GLOBAL ~

Direx {dir}                                                *:Direx*

	Open a Direx buffer in {dir}.

	If {dir} is not provided, then reload the buffer if it is a Direx buffer,
	or open the parent directory of the current buffer otherwise.

Find {pattern}                                          *:Find* *direx-:Find*
    Find files/directories matching {pattern} from the |current-directory|.
    Show results in a |quickfix| list.

[range]Grep {args}                                      *:Grep* *direx-:Grep*

    Use external grep tool set by |'grepprg'| and |'grepformat'| to search for
    {args} from the |current-directory|. Show results in a |quickfix| list.

	Note: Unlike core |:grep| command, Direx's |:Grep| is asynchronous, and
	will raise an error if |'grepprg'| is empty or set to `"internal"`

    If `opts.grep.parse_args` is `"shell"`, then the {args} are parsed by your
    |'shell'|. Pattern come from `range` are handled by `shellescape()` before
    passing to your shell. This is useful if you want to add more arguments
    when using `:Grep` command.

    Otherwise, the {args} are passed to `'shell'` as a single string argument.

    Note: If your |'grepprg'| uses `rg`, it is recommended to add arguments
    `-j1` or limit `--max-columns` to a positive number to avoid memory issues.
    See https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2505 and `:Man rg`


BUFFER LOCAL ~

The following commands are only available in the Direx buffer. ~

[range]Cut                                                      *direx-:Cut*
[range]Copy                                                     *direx-:Copy*

    Cut or copy the selected files/directories, to be used with
    |direx-:Paste|. If no range is provided, the file/directory in the current
    line is cut/copied

Paste                                                           *direx-:Paste*

    Paste the files/directories cut/copied with |direx-:Cut| or |direx-:Copy|
    into the current directory. Also trigger `workspace/willRenameFiles` and
    `workspace/didRenameFiles` LSP method if the files were cut.

[range]Trash[!]                                                 *direx-:Trash*

    Move the selected files/directories to the trash directory. Use `trash`
    cli if available, otherwise fallback to built-in implementation based on
    FreeDesktop Trash Spec (https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/trash-spec)

	Note: The built-in implementation only works in Desktop Environments that
	support FreeDesktop Trash Spec, such as GNOME, KDE, Xfce

    Also trigger `workspace/willDeleteFiles` and `workspace/didDeleteFiles`
    LSP method.

    A confirmation prompt will be shown before the operation is executed. Add
    bang (!) to execute without confirmation.

[range]Remove[!]                                                *direx-:Remove*

    Remove the selected files/directories. For directories, remove them
    recursively.

    Also trigger `workspace/willDeleteFiles` and `workspace/didDeleteFiles`
    LSP method.

    A confirmation prompt will be shown before the operation is executed. Add
    bang to execute without confirmation.

LFind {pattern}                                                 *direx-:LFind*
    Same as |:Find|, except that the current buffer name is used as the
    directory to search from, and |location-list| is used instead of
    |quickfix|.

LGrep {args}                                                    *direx-:LGrep*
    Same as |:Grep|, except that the current buffer name is used as the
    directory to search from, and |location-list| is used instead of
    |quickfix|. Doesn't support |range|

The following commands are available in both Direx buffers and ~
quickfix/location list buffers opened by |:Find| and |:LFind| ~

[range]Shdo {cmd}                                              *direx-:Shdo*

    Generates a shell script with {cmd} applied to [range] and the
    respective filepath inserted wherever {} appears in {cmd}. The
    window-local directory is initialized to the current Dirvish
    directory.

    For example, to rename a list of visual-selected files: >vim
        :'<,'>Shdo mv {} {}-copy.txt
<    Run the script with ":!%".

Creating file and directory with Direx ~

Direx doesn't provide any commands for creating file or directory, but, you
can use |:e| and |:w| to create a file. For example, if you are in a Direx
buffer named `~/.config/nvim/`, you can create file
`~/.config/nvim/ftplugin/direx.lua` like this: >vim
	:e %ftplugin/direx.lua
	:w ++p
<
Similarly, you can create a directory, for example `~/.config/nvim/lua` using
shell command like `mkdir`: >vim
	:!mkdir %lua
<
See also |cmdline-special|, |expand()|, |filename-modifiers|.

How to reload Direx buffer? ~

Use either |:e| or |:Direx|

How to do an operation on multiple files in non-adjacent lines? ~

Remember that you can slice, dice, and smash any Direx buffer without
modifying the filesystem? You can just use |d| to remove the lines in between
that you don’t want to be included in the operation. After the operation, you
can use |:e| to reload the buffer.

Possibly in the future, Direx will support a way to mark files/directories for
operations.

How to open Direx in a split? ~

Combine with |:split| or |:vsplit|
For example: >vim
	:split | Direx
	:vsplit | Direx
<
You can also create commands >vim
	command! -nargs=* DirexSplit :split | Direx <args>
	command! -nargs=* DirexVSplit :vsplit | Direx <args>
<
